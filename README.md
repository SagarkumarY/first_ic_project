# DKeeper - A Decentralized Note Management Application
Overview
DKeeper is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to help users manage their notes in a secure and efficient way. Built using Motoko for the backend and React.js for the frontend, this project showcases the power of decentralized storage while maintaining a simple, intuitive interface.



### Features

Create Notes: Add new notes with a title and content.

Read Notes: View all your saved notes in one place.

Update Notes: Modify any existing note directly from the app.

Delete Notes: Remove unwanted notes with a single click.

Real-time Updates: Experience seamless synchronization with every action.
Technology Stack

Backend: Built with the Motoko programming language, running on the Internet Computer to ensure decentralized data storage.

Frontend: Built using React.js, featuring dynamic UI components and modern design principles.

State Management: React hooks and functional components for managing application state.

UI Components: Interactive and reusable UI components built with shadcn/ui.
Key Highlights

Decentralized: All data is stored securely on the blockchain using the Internet Computer.

Fully Functional CRUD: Users can create, read, update, and delete notes with real-time feedback.

Clean and Modern UI: A sleek, user-friendly design powered by React and shadcn UI.

Scalable & Extensible: Designed for scalability, allowing easy additions of new features and improvements.

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dkeeper/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
